# punch-Out!!

http://github.com/trutch/punch-out

Wanted a watch face to honor my favorite NES game. Currently only works on vivoactive HR and will likely stay that way since it's the only watch I own.

## Current features:

* Move bar
* Max heartrate over last 20 readings
* Battery Indicator
* Steps completed
* Time and date
* Knock out your opponent when goal is reached

## Version Notes:

```
v1.0.3 - Fixed Heartrate, Added Battery Indicator and Step Goal Information
v1.0.2 - Fixed Time Settings and Progress Bar Bugs 
v1.0.1 - Added Launcher Icon and internal optimizations
v1.0.0 - Initial Release
```
